### Recreation

The singular _[ludus](</wiki/Ludus_(ancient*Rome)> 'Ludus (ancient Rome)')*, \"play, game, sport, training,\" had a wide range of meanings such as \"word play,\" \"theatrical performance,\" \"board game,\" \"primary school,\" and even \"gladiator training school\" (as in _[Ludus Magnus](/wiki/Ludus_Magnus 'Ludus Magnus')_). Activities for children and young people in the Empire included [hoop rolling](/wiki/Hoop_rolling#Ancient_Rome_and_Byzantium 'Hoop rolling') and [knucklebones](/wiki/Knucklebones 'Knucklebones') (_astragali_ or \"jacks\"). Girls had [dolls](/wiki/Doll 'Doll') made of wood, [terracotta](/wiki/Terracotta 'Terracotta'), and especially [bone and ivory](/wiki/Ivory_carving 'Ivory carving'). Ball games include [trigon](</wiki/Trigon_(game)> 'Trigon (game)') and [harpastum](/wiki/Harpastum 'Harpastum'). People of all ages played [board games](/wiki/Board_game 'Board game'), including _[latrunculi](/wiki/Ludus_latrunculorum 'Ludus latrunculorum')_ (\"Raiders\") and _[XII scripta](/wiki/Ludus_duodecim_scriptorum 'Ludus duodecim scriptorum')_ (\"Twelve Marks\"). A game referred to as _alea_ (dice) or _tabula_ (the board) may have been similar to [backgammon](/wiki/Backgammon 'Backgammon'). [Dicing](/wiki/Dice 'Dice') as a form of gambling was disapproved of, but was a popular pastime during the festival of the [Saturnalia](/wiki/Saturnalia 'Saturnalia').
